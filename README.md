# Excel_Challenge
Crowdfunding

This repository contains CrowdfundingBook.xlsx, Excel-challenge-questionnaire files.

This is a  Project that analyses the database of one thousand crowdfunding campaigns with World Excel. To achieve this goal, I used common sorting and summarising Excel technics to clean the database and made several tables and charts to visualize the data and analyze if there was any trend between different aspects of the campaigns. In the end, I answered some questions about how this project could be improved and listed the conclusions from the dataset.
